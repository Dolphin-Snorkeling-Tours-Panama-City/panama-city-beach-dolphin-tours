"@type": "Answer",
"text": "Dolphinaria might have you believe that dolphins are not apex predators of the ocean. They can kill sharks and should be treated accordingly. The aggressive nature of dolphins can make them dangerous to humans, other dolphins and even cause self-harm. The majority of dolphins found in the United States are kept in captivity. However, they are not domesticated."

<div><p>Panama City Beach is the ideal place to swim with dolphins. Panama City has a lot to offer, including wild dolphins and marine parks that have dolphins who are as excited to meet you as you are!</p><p>Dolphins may be tempted to swim alongside boats in order to satisfy their curiosity. <i>Seaside</i>  Dolphins feel the need to explore the wake left by boats. <i>Navigation</i>  The wake can cause dolphins to jump out of the water and make it seem like they're playing.</p><p>When we take visitors and locals on dolphin tours in Panama City Beach. Also one of our number one priority is to make sure that the dolphins aren’t disturbed as they go about their day. That said, we know all the places where schools of dolphins like to congregate, and we’ll take you all around the beautiful Gulf of Mexico so that you can see these beautiful dolphins enjoying their natural habitat.</p></div>

Dolphins have to be able to both breathe oxygen from air and remain in water. Jumping from the water allows dolphins to be dry and take in oxygen. Dolphins leap from the water to enjoy, to enhance visibility, to remove parasites or improve navigation.</p> </div>
