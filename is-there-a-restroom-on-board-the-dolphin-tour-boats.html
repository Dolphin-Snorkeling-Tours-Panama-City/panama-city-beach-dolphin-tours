<div><p>Panama City Beach: Gulf World Marine Park</p><p>Destin. Destin is often known as Florida's beach with the most clear water. Why is this beach special? It's the Choctawhatchee Bay right beyond the beach which acts as a filter taking in the darker sediment, leaving clear waters on top of Destin's fine quartz.</p><p>Opportunities to swim with dolphins are available in several warm-water locations, including Hawaii. Costs are typical: A simple shallow-water interaction[1] may cost around $80-$145. <b>Wonder</b>  Prices will vary depending on the resort's location and the dolphins behavior.</p></div>
