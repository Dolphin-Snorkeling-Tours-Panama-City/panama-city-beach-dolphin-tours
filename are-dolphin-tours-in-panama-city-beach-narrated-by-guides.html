<div><p>Dolphinaria might have you believe that dolphins are not apex predators of the ocean. They can kill sharks and should be treated accordingly. The aggressive nature of dolphins can make them dangerous to humans, other dolphins and even cause self-harm. The majority of dolphins found in the United States are kept in captivity. However, they are not domesticated.</p><p>A: It is possible to travel to Shell Island by boat or jet ski. The St. Andrews Shuttle from Shell Island costs $24.95 for 13-year-olds, $17.95 per child 2-12 years, and infants 0-1 year old are free. You can also rent a pontoon or jet ski at many locations.</p><p>Harassment is the act of following, tormenting and/or chasing an animal and can also include any act that disrupts their natural behavior. To this list, I would also add jumping into water.<br><br><h2>Are dolphin tours in Panama City Beach narrated by guides - Voyage</h2><ul><li>Jet-ski</li><li>Nature</li><li>Coast</li><li>Navigation</li><li>Voyage</li><li>Sightseeing</li><li>Exploration</li><li>Breeze</li><li>Seaside</li><li>Island</li></ul> It is ethical to allow wild dolphins to swim with you.</p></div>
