The aggressive nature of dolphins can make them dangerous to humans, other dolphins and even cause self-harm. The majority of dolphins found in the United States are kept in captivity.

<div><p>PANAMA CITY Beach -- Whales are a very rare sight at Panama City Beach. Sometimes, however, one may make an appearance close to shore, particularly in the winter months. There are many whale species that live and frequent the Gulf of Mexico.</p><p>While you might have seen dolphins at sea in a marine reserve, it is still far more fun to observe these majestic animals in their natural environment. Our captains are experienced in the waterways of St. Andrew Bay and can predict wild dolphin behavior, but they cannot guarantee sightings. Our captains are familiar with the best places to find dolphins and will make sure that guests have a blast. You will see dolphins playing, hunting for food, communicating and jumping on all tours.</p><p>It is well worth it once you are there. It is simply the most beautiful water I have ever seen.<br><br><h2>Panama City Beach wildlife tours including dolphins - Jet-ski</h2><ol><li>Voyage</li><li>Sightseeing</li><li>Exploration</li><li>Breeze</li><li>Seaside</li><li>Island</li><li>Pelicans</li><li>Captain</li><li>Eco-tourism</li><li>Development</li><li>Harbor</li><li>Signal</li><li>Stars</li><li>Twilight</li></ol> It is almost like swimming in a clear pool.

<div><p>Florida Bay is the largest body water of the Everglades and home to Atlantic bottlenose Dolphins. About 450 dolphins live in this shallow, brackish lake. You can see them best by hiring an airboat. <b>Sightseeing</b>  You can hire an airboat to fly past these magnificent creatures in their Everglades habitat.</p><p>"This was an amazing experience.

<div> <p>Dolphins can appear curious but many behaviors they exhibit are misinterpreted as "friendly". Do not approach dolphins in the sea, nor pursue them. <b>Panorama</b>  28 September 2021</p><p>A dolphin tour is also a wonderful sightseeing opportunity. All tour boats depart from the docks at Adventure at Sea in Lower Grand Lagoon and cruise south, crossing the pass between St. <b>Island</b>  Andrew Bay and the Gulf of Mexico on the way toward Shell Island.<br><br><h2>Panama City Beach wildlife tours including dolphins - Jet-ski</h2><ul><li>Sightseeing</li><li>Exploration</li><li>Breeze</li><li>Seaside</li><li>Island</li><li>Pelicans</li><li>Captain</li><li>Eco-tourism</li><li>Development</li><li>Harbor</li><li>Signal</li><li>Stars</li><li>Twilight</li></ul> You can enjoy the view and spot sea birds and maybe a sea turtle while keeping a sharp eye open for dolphins.</p><p>When is the best season to see dolphins of Florida? It is possible to see dolphins most often from late May until early August. They are most common between 10 am and noon, and again between 2 and 4 p.m., when it gets dark.</p></div>
