<div> <p>Do not touch dolphins. If the dolphins would like to touch you, they'll do it. You can touch only one dolphin at a time, and all other dolphins will flee the area. This can negatively impact dolphin behavior and cause irritation among other people in your group.</p><p>Some dolphins living in coastal areas at higher latitudes have a tendency to migrate south during the winter. The Atlantic side of the U.S. has coastal bottlenose dolphins that migrate seasonally between New Jersey (N.
